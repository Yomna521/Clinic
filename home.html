<h1>Welcome to The Clinic</h1>
<a href="About.jpeg"><img id="clinicImage" src="About.jpeg" alt="clinic image"></a>
<p class="about">Our story began with a belief that we belong to nature so if we are a tree, our health and well being are the root, our happiness is the fruit and hope is how we water and nurture ourselves. We also believe that we all human beings, patients, doctors, nurses, helpers, etc. share the same blend of joy and pain in our life journey.</p>
<br>
<p class="about">The Clinic was established in El Nozha to be one of the first and most prestigious medical care facilities service in the district. Our group of consultants were carefully selected to comprise only the best in Egypt and probably around the world. All our doctors are highly qualified with extensive internal and international training as well as friendly & professional communication skills. </p>
<br>
<p class="about">Our staff of nurses are very well trained to provide you with the ultimate care needed. The clinic is situated in the most advanced and elegant medical complex building in Cairo (Health Care City – HCC). The whole basement floor is utilized by Misr Radiology Center where state of the art technologies and facilities are available (High resolution MRI, 3D U/S, Isotope scan, U/S mammography, MR Spectroscopy, spiral ct angiography, mammography and interventional radiology).
